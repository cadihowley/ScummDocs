Many games supported by ScummVM can still be bought, and many others have been released for free download by their copyright holders. Most games have demo versions to try out which also run with ScummVM. These can be downloaded from the [ScummVM demos page](https://scummvm.org/demos/)

For other out of print games, try [Amazon](amazon.com), [eBay](ebay.com), [Game Trading Zone](https://gametz.com/) or other auction sites. Beware of faulty games (scratched disks etc) and illegal game copies such as from [Butterfly Media](https://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=3443)

While the ScummVM team does not recommend any individual supplier of games, the project does get a cut from every purchase on GOG.com through the affiliate links below.

### LucasArts Games

:::note
It is possible to extract the files of the "classic" mode of the special editions of [The Secret of Monkey Island](monkey.md) and [Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge](monkey2.md) and make them [playable](https://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=7671).

It is also possible to extract the files of the "classic" mode of the remastered version of [Day of the Tentacle](tentacle.md), as well as the "enhanced" (V2 DOS) version of [Maniac Mansion](maniac.md) and make them playable via ScummVM using [DoubleFine Explorer](https://quickandeasysoftware.net/software/doublefine-explorer) - however only the classic mode is playable in ScummVM.
