Many games supported by ScummVM can still be bought, and many others have been released for free download by their copyright holders. Most games have demo versions to try out which also run with ScummVM. These can be downloaded from the [ScummVM demos page](https://scummvm.org/demos/)

For other out of print games, try [Amazon](amazon.com), [eBay](ebay.com), [Game Trading Zone](https://gametz.com/) or other auction sites. Beware of faulty games (scratched disks etc) and illegal game copies such as from [Butterfly Media](https://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=3443)

While the ScummVM team does not recommend any individual supplier of games, the project does get a cut from every purchase on GOG.com through affiliate links.
