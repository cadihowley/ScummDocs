## What is ScummVM?

ScummVM is a program which allows you to run certain classic graphical point-and-click adventure games, provided you already have their data files. The clever part about this: ScummVM just replaces the executables shipped with the game, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed!

Originally it was designed to run LucasArts' SCUMM games, such as Maniac Mansion, Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle or Sam and Max. SCUMM stands for 'Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion', which was the first game for which LucasArts designed this system. And much later it gave its name to ScummVM ('VM' meaning Virtual Machine).

Over time support for a lot of non-SCUMM games has been added, and ScummVM now also supports many of Sierra's AGI and SCI games (such as King's Quest 1-7, Space Quest 1-6, ...), Discworld 1 and 2, Simon the Sorcerer 1 and 2, Beneath A Steel Sky, Lure of the Temptress, Broken Sword I and II, Flight of the Amazon Queen, Gobliiins 1-3, The Legend of Kyrandia series, many of Humongous Entertainment's children's SCUMM games (including Freddi Fish and Putt Putt games) and many more. You can find a full list with details on which adventures are supported and how well on the compatibility page. ScummVM is continually improving, so check back often.

Among the systems on which you can play those games are regular desktop computers (running Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, ...), game consoles (Dreamcast, Nintendo DS & Wii, PS2, PSP, ...), smartphones (Android, iPhone, PocketPC, Symbian ...) and more.

At this time ScummVM is still under heavy development. Be aware that whilst we attempt to make sure that many games can be completed with few major bugs, crashes can happen and we offer no warranty. That being said, some of the games have been supported for a long time and should work fine with any recent stable release. You can get a feeling of how well each game is working in ScummVM by looking at the compatibility page. Actually, if you browse a bit around you might discover that ScummVM is even being used commercially to re-release some of the supported games on modern platforms. This shows that several companies are happy with the quality of the software and how well it can run some of the games.
