## Loom <a name="loom"></a>
### About

Loom was the fourth game to use the SCUMM scripting language. The game follows Bobbin Threadbare as he learns how to use his magical powers through his distaff and as he eventually saves the world from the Lord of Chaos, who was unraveling the Loom (the source of power for the members of the weaver's guild).

### Variants

The DOS CD version of this was a "talkie version" presented in 256 colors, however unlike most talkie games the speech came from CDDA tracks on the CD. Due to limitations in lip-syncing at the time, the DOS CD version did not include the scenes where the characters were presented in close-up shots. The FM Towns CD version was also presented in 256 colors, however it was not a talkie. As a result, the close-up shots were present in the FM Towns versions.

The DOS floppy EGA version contained only 16 colors.
