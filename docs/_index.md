title: Proposal GSOD 2020
---
### Objectives

1. To produce high-quality end user documentation by consolidating large amounts of information from disparate sources and re-writing information for clarity and consistency. Documentation should be easy to understand for beginners, without being patronizing to tech-savvy users. 
2. To create a documentation portal using a static-site generator such as Docusaurus or ReadtheDocs.
3. To future-proof end user documentation by creating templates and detailed how-to instructions for future open source contributors.

### Areas of Focus

1.  New users need a comprehensive guide for installing ScummVM on any of the supported platforms, especially in cases where the install is not intuitive, or the user may not have a strong technical base. 

2.  Advanced users need additional behind-the-scenes options to tweak how their games run, including how to report any bugs. 

3.  Information relating to each supported game needs to be in one place - a "one-stop-shop" approach - including, but not limited to;
   * What is the game about, and if the user doesn't have the game, where can they get it?
   * Is there anything unusual the user needs to know about the install?
   * What are the engine-specific controls the user should know about?
   * Are there any known problems with the game when played via ScummVM?

###  Plan of Attack

I am in a position where I can work on this project full-time for the span of the three month GSOD timeline. 

I propose to start by combing the existing documentation; Readme, Website and Wiki. As I go, I will re-write and add to each section as required. I will ensure that information gathered from these pre-existing sources is removed on completion of the project to prevent double-ups and contradictions.

Once this preliminary work is done, I will coordinate with developers and port maintainers to ensure the information presented in the documentation is as comprehensive as possible. 

### Why me?

I believe I am well suited to the project because:
  * The ScummVM project personally interests me. 
    * I believe you work better when you care about what you're working on. I grew up on retro games in the early 90s! 
  * I'm good at taking complex information and making it easy to understand. 
    * In the past I wrote aviation Operating Manuals as part of my work.
  * I have an innate curiosity for things I don't know, and a willingness to learn. 
    * This will serve me well as I delve deeper into the workings of ScummVM. Just in the course of writing this proposal, I taught myself how to set up a Raspberry Pi, use it as a server, and create a Docusaurus site (including basic JS!).
  * I'm an excellent communicator. 
    * This is critical for both the writing of the documentation, but also for getting the right information from the subject matter experts.
