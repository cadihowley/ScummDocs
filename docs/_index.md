### Objectives

1. To produce high-quality end user documentation by consolidating large amounts of information from disparate sources and re-writing information for clarity and consistency. Documentation should be easy to understand for beginners, without being patronizing to tech-savvy users. 
2. To create a documentation portal using a static-site generator such as Docusaurus or ReadtheDocs.
3. To future-proof end user documentation by creating templates and detailed how-to instructions for future open source contributors.

### Areas of Focus

1.  New users need a comprehensive guide for installing ScummVM on any of the supported platforms, especially in cases where the install is not intuitive, or the user may not have a strong technical base. 

2.  Advanced users need additional behind-the-scenes options to tweak how their games run, including how to report any bugs. 

3.  Information relating to each supported game needs to be in one place, including, but not limited to;
   * What is the game about, and if the user doesn't have the game, where can they get it?
   * Is there anything unusual the user needs to know about the install?
   * What are the engine or game-specific controls the user should know about?
   * Are there any known problems with the game when played via ScummVM?
